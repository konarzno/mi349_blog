            Hi! I'm Noah, a junior student at Michigan State University with an Interactive Games and Media major and a minor in Game Design and Development. I am currently taking MI 349, which is Web Design and Development, and this is a website that
            I created as a project for this class.

            One of my main hobbies is playing all kinds of video games. Obviously I like video games as they're my field of study, but I enjoy a really broad variety of games and game genres, from whatever the big game is right now to smaller indie games that
            get little recognition. Some of my favorite games of all time include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Terraria</li>
            <li>Plants vs. Zombies</li>
            <li>The Yakuza Series</li>
            <li>The Binding of Isaac</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also play a bunch of board games as well. My favorite is probably Blood on the Clocktower, and I usually play board games with my friends on campus through MSU Tabletop Club.
