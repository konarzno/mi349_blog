        <h1>A Day in the Life of Noah Konarz (Monday)</h1>

        <h2>Morning</h2>
        <p>My Monday begins by waking up to my alarm at <strong>10 am</strong>. I usually snooze it for about 10 minutes before waking up and getting ready by brushing my teeth, washing my face, getting dressed, etc. By <strong>10:30</strong>, I am waiting for my apartment's shuttle to come and bring me to campus, where I then head to my job at the Library's <a href="https://lib.msu.edu/dmc">Digital Multimedia Center</a> until <strong>2 pm</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Afternoon</h2>
        <p>After finishing my shift at the library, I go to the International Center to grab lunch. The lines can be pretty long but generally I will either:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get Panda Express</li>
            <li>Get Woody's, if the Panda line is too long.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After finishing lunch I'll head to my <strong>3 pm</strong> Level Design class, which lasts until <strong>5 pm.</strong>

        <h2>Evening</h2>
        <p>Post class I usually head back to the library to study/hangout with some friends at the library for a few hours until <em>Weezer Club</em> at <strong>8 pm</strong>, which generally is around two hours long.</p>

        <h2>Night</h2>
        <p>After <em>Weezer Club</em>, I usually grab a later dinner with my friends from the club and head home. When I get home, I take a shower and then hop online with some friends and we play video games. Some of the games we play include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marvel Rivals</li>
            <li>2XKO</li>
            <li>Bloons Tower Defense 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We usually play for a couple of hours, after which I head to bed, thus ending my Monday.</p>
